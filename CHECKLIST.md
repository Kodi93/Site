# Phase-1 Checklist

- [ ] Gradient background (#2a0c6a → #9b0f62 → #0a0810) and sticky header with grabgifts.svg icon ship on every page.
- [ ] Hero matches the reference: lowercase title, two-line tagline, and buttons linking to /guides/, /surprise/, and /changelog/.
- [ ] Navigation and disclosure follow spec (header nav links inline, disclosure text lives only on /faq/).
- [ ] All views render through `templates/base.html` with `/assets/theme.css` as the single stylesheet.
- [ ] Product and guide cards appear only with verified images, and generators respect protected layout files.
- [ ] `tools/check_phase.mjs` passes to confirm Phase-1 gate compliance.
