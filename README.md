# Grab Gifts

Grab Gifts powers [grabgifts.net](https://grabgifts.net) — an automated static site generator that hunts trending gift ideas from Amazon's Product Advertising API, layers on conversion-primed storytelling, and publishes them into ten high-intent shopping vibes (think "Gifts for Him", "Tech & Gadgets", and more). The build also injects Google AdSense placements and your Amazon affiliate links so the site can monetize from day one.

## Features

- **Ten opinionated categories** tuned for gift discovery, mirroring the browsing experience of sites like *dudeiwantthat.com*.
- **Daily automation pipeline** that bootstraps 100 high-quality listings on the first run, then adds five best-in-class products per day with long-form promotional copy and a full static site rebuild.
- **Autogenerated roundup playbooks** that publish 15+ "Top 10 under $X" lists every run with internal product detail pages and tagged Amazon search links.
- **Affiliate-ready links** that enforce your Amazon partner tag on every product card and category deep-link.
- **AdSense support** baked into the base layout so ads render on each page once you provide your client and slot IDs.
- **Conversion-focused cards** that surface Amazon star ratings and add a direct “Shop on Amazon” button alongside internal hype links.
- **Multi-marketplace aggregation** with Amazon PA-API data, eBay Browse API results, and optional JSON feeds for additional retailers or curated partners.
- **Automated price history** that records every refresh and calls out live drops, lowest-ever prices, and trend directions on product pages.
- **Advanced discovery tools** including price/rating/retailer filters, retailer badges, and a built-in wishlist/share workflow for every product.
- **Analytics and audience growth ready** with GA4 snippet injection plus an inline newsletter form that posts straight to your ESP.
- **SEO-friendly pages** with dynamic metadata, schema.org markup, RSS feed, and sitemaps that advertise last-modified times.
- **No external dependencies** – the tooling runs entirely on Python’s standard library so it can execute in constrained hosting environments.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- Python 3.11+ (the standard library client relies on `hmac` and modern typing features).
- Valid Amazon Product Advertising API (PA-API) credentials: an access key, secret key, and associate tag.
- A configured Google AdSense account (client ID and optional slot ID) if you want ad units injected.

No `pip install` step is required because the project only uses the Python standard library.

## Configuration

The CLI reads configuration from environment variables so you can keep secrets outside of source control.

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AMAZON_PAAPI_ACCESS_KEY` | Yes (for `update`) | AWS access key for PA-API 5 requests |
| `AMAZON_PAAPI_SECRET_KEY` | Yes (for `update`) | AWS secret key for PA-API 5 requests |
| `AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG` | Yes | Your Amazon affiliate tag appended to every link |
| `AMAZON_MARKETPLACE` | No | Marketplace domain (default `www.amazon.com`) |
| `AMAZON_API_HOST` | No | API host (default `webservices.amazon.com`) |
| `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` | Yes (for eBay sourcing) | eBay App ID used for OAuth client-credentials flow |
| `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes (for eBay sourcing) | eBay Client Secret paired with the App ID |
| `EBAY_DEV_ID` | Yes (for eBay sourcing) | eBay Developer ID included in API headers |
| `EBAY_CAMPAIGN_ID` | No | Optional eBay Partner Network campaign ID appended to outbound links |
| `SITE_NAME` | No | Display name shown in the header |
| `SITE_DESCRIPTION` | No | Homepage meta description |
| `SITE_BASE_URL` | No | Canonical base URL used in sitemaps and canonical tags |
| `ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID` | No | Google AdSense client ID (format `ca-pub-XXXXXXXX`) |
| `ADSENSE_SLOT` | No | Optional AdSense slot for in-content ads |
| `SITE_TWITTER` / `SITE_FACEBOOK` | No | Social handles exposed in structured data |
| `SITE_LANGUAGE` | No | Language code applied to the `<html lang>` attribute |
| `SITE_LOCALE` | No | Locale value used for Open Graph metadata |
| `SITE_LOGO_URL` | No | Absolute URL for your logo used in structured data and Open Graph fallbacks |
| `SITE_FAVICON_URL` | No | Absolute URL for the favicon referenced in page `<head>` |
| `SITE_ANALYTICS_ID` | No | GA4 Measurement ID used to auto-inject the gtag loader |
| `SITE_ANALYTICS_SNIPPET` | No | Full analytics snippet (overrides `SITE_ANALYTICS_ID` when set) |
| `SITE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ACTION` | No | Endpoint that receives email submissions for the inline banner |
| `SITE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_METHOD` | No | HTTP method for the signup form (defaults to `post`) |
| `SITE_NEWSLETTER_EMAIL_FIELD` | No | The `name` attribute applied to the email input (default `email`) |
| `SITE_NEWSLETTER_HIDDEN_INPUTS` | No | Extra hidden inputs encoded as a query string (e.g. `u=123&id=abc`) |
| `SITE_NEWSLETTER_CTA_COPY` | No | Custom label for the newsletter button/submit action |
| `STATIC_RETAILER_DIR` | No | Directory containing JSON retailer feeds (defaults to `data/retailers`) |

The verification token expected by `netlify/functions/accountDeletion` is hard-coded to `gdel1f4f2f7c9b0a4f2e86b0bb7fb6c0f1a5`. Configure the marketplace console to send that value in the `x-verification-token` header (or update `EXPECTED_TOKEN` in the function before deploying if you need to rotate it).

If both `SITE_ANALYTICS_ID` and `SITE_ANALYTICS_SNIPPET` are present, the raw snippet takes precedence. Hidden newsletter inputs are supplied as a URL query string so you can include provider-specific fields (e.g. `u`, `id`, `form` IDs) without editing templates.

The Netlify Function that receives marketplace deletion notifications lives at `netlify/functions/accountDeletion.js` and is exposed publicly at `/.netlify/functions/accountDeletion`.

### Newsletter form wiring

Set `SITE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ACTION` to the endpoint provided by your ESP to transform the homepage banner into an inline signup form. The email input name defaults to `email`, but you can override it with `SITE_NEWSLETTER_EMAIL_FIELD`. Any additional provider requirements (tags, list IDs, etc.) go into `SITE_NEWSLETTER_HIDDEN_INPUTS` as a query string.

Example configuration for two common providers:

```bash
# ConvertKit
export SITE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ACTION=https://app.convertkit.com/forms/1234567/subscriptions
export SITE_NEWSLETTER_HIDDEN_INPUTS=form=1234567

# Mailchimp (requires GET)
export SITE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ACTION=https://example.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe/post
export SITE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_METHOD=get
export SITE_NEWSLETTER_EMAIL_FIELD=EMAIL
export SITE_NEWSLETTER_HIDDEN_INPUTS="u=abcd1234&id=efgh5678"
```

When a form action is configured the navigation “Newsletter” link jumps to the inline banner; otherwise it links to `SITE_NEWSLETTER_URL`.

The CLI reads credentials from environment variables so secrets stay out of version control—never commit Amazon or eBay keys into the repository. Populate the variables in your shell, CI, or hosting provider before running commands.

### Adding additional retailers

The pipeline automatically picks up any JSON feeds stored in `data/retailers/` (or a directory specified with `STATIC_RETAILER_DIR`). A feed can be a single JSON file or a directory containing multiple JSON fragments, letting you append new products without touching existing files. For directory-based feeds, include a `meta.json` (or `metadata.json`) file alongside the item blobs to override the display name, CTA label, or homepage URL.

Each JSON entry should mirror the built-in Amazon/eBay adapter keys: `id`, `title`, `url`, `price`, `image`, `rating`, `total_reviews`, `features`, and `keywords`. Optional per-item fields such as `category_slug` and `category` keep curated products labeled correctly across the generated site. Pointer files may also reference nested folders using `items_dir`, `items_path`, `items_file`, or `items_files`; the loader resolves those references automatically and de-duplicates products by `id`/`asin`.


Example feed (`data/retailers/handmade.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "Handmade Marketplace",
  "homepage": "https://example.com",
  "cta_label": "Shop this maker",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "artisan-001",
      "title": "Artisan Pour-over Stand",
      "url": "https://example.com/products/artisan-001",
      "price": "$68.00",
      "image": "https://example.com/images/artisan-001.jpg",
      "rating": 4.8,
      "total_reviews": 112,
      "features": ["walnut", "handmade"],
      "keywords": ["coffee", "pour over"],
      "category_slug": "home-and-kitchen",
      "category": "Homebody Upgrades"
    }
  ]
}
```

Directory-backed feed layout:

```
data/retailers/amazon-sitestripe/
├── meta.json            # optional retailer display overrides
├── items/
│   ├── amzn-3I1wmJZ.json  # single product JSON blobs
│   └── amzn-3I2aKND.json  # drop new files for additional URLs
└── batches/
    ├── batch-0001.json    # { "items": [ ... ] }
    └── batch-0002.json    # append new URLs in additional batches
```

Each JSON file is merged, de-duplicated by `id`, and sorted automatically during ingestion so you can add new SiteStripe links by dropping a fresh file without editing previous ones.

If you already know which on-site category an item belongs to, include `category_slug` (matching one of the slugs listed in `giftgrab.config.DEFAULT_CATEGORIES`) and `category` (the friendly display name). Those fields keep per-item landing pages and search results labeled correctly even when a curated feed skips the automated keyword matching step.
Every retailer feed is merged alongside Amazon data, producing separate product cards with the correct outbound CTA, retailer badge, and inclusion in the site-wide search filters.

### eBay Browse API sourcing

When `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`, `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `EBAY_DEV_ID` are present, the pipeline instantiates an eBay retailer adapter alongside Amazon and static feeds. The adapter performs a client-credentials OAuth exchange against `api.ebay.com`, queries the Browse API for each category’s keyword set, normalizes the response into the shared product schema, and appends the optional `EBAY_CAMPAIGN_ID` to outbound links for Partner Network tracking. Because authentication material lives entirely in environment variables, you can rotate or revoke keys without touching the repository.

## Usage

1. **Initial data fetch and site build**

   ```bash
   export AMAZON_PAAPI_ACCESS_KEY=...
   export AMAZON_PAAPI_SECRET_KEY=...
   export AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG=yourtag-20
   export ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   export SITE_BASE_URL=https://gifts.example.com

   python -m giftgrab.cli update --item-count 6
   ```

   The command will:

   - fetch `item-count` products for each of the ten categories (automatically scaling to source at least 100 listings on the very first run),
   - auto-write persuasive blog copy—including campaign playbooks and launch checklists—for every item,
   - persist everything to `data/products.json`,
   - render the full static site into the `public/` folder (index, categories, product pages, RSS, and sitemap).

2. **Regenerate site without hitting Amazon**

   If you only changed styles or copy templates, skip the API requests and rebuild from stored data:

   ```bash
   python -m giftgrab.cli generate
   ```

3. **Generate roundup playbooks and product breakdowns**

   The roundup workflow synthesizes 15 topic/cap combinations from [`config/roundups.json`](config/roundups.json), creates ten generated products for each, and publishes a roundup landing page that links to the new product breakdowns. Run it manually with:

   ```bash
   python -m giftgrab.cli roundups
   ```

   Use the optional flags to scale output:

   ```bash
   # Generate a full year (365 days) of 15-per-day roundups starting January 1st
   python -m giftgrab.cli roundups \
     --roundup-days 365 \
     --roundup-limit 15 \
     --roundup-start-date 2024-01-01 \
     --roundup-seed editorial-calendar
   ```

   The command persists all generated content to JSON, refreshes the static site, and highlights the highest scoring product as “Best Gift This Week” on the homepage. You can invoke the same logic via `python scripts/daily_roundups.py --days 30 --limit 15` if you prefer the lightweight helper entrypoint.

4. **Schedule daily automation**

   Use cron (or a serverless scheduler) to refresh the catalogue automatically every morning:

   ```cron
   # Run at 6:00 AM server time
   0 5 * * * cd /var/www/gifts && /usr/bin/env -S bash -lc 'python -m giftgrab.cli update --item-count 8'
   30 5 * * * cd /var/www/gifts && /usr/bin/env -S bash -lc 'python -m giftgrab.cli roundups --roundup-days 1 --roundup-limit 15'
   ```

   The first cron line refreshes retailer products; the second synthesizes fresh roundup content. Both commands are idempotent – products are upserted by ASIN and generated content is updated by slug so reruns safely refresh existing records while appending new finds. Adjust `--roundup-days` and `--roundup-start-date` for seasonal batches (for example, run once a quarter with `--roundup-days 90`).

## Deploying the static site

The generated HTML lives in `public/`. You can deploy it to any static hosting provider:

- **Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages** – point the build command to `python -m giftgrab.cli update` and publish the `public` directory.
- **Amazon S3 + CloudFront** – sync the `public/` folder to S3 and enable CDN caching.
- **Traditional hosting** – rsync the directory to your web server's document root.

Because the output is static, the site is fast, cache-friendly, and inexpensive to host.

### Marketplace account deletion webhook

Deploying the deletion handler follows the same workflow as the static site when using Netlify Functions:

1. **Push the function** – keep `netlify/functions/accountDeletion.js` in your repository so Netlify packages it automatically during deploys (no additional build step is required).
2. **Configure the secret** – register the verification token `gdel1f4f2f7c9b0a4f2e86b0bb7fb6c0f1a5` in the marketplace console. eBay signs each deletion payload with this token and includes the signature in the `X-EBAY-SIGNATURE` header. Update `EXPECTED_TOKEN` in the function before deploying if you need to rotate it.
3. **Verify with the marketplace** – once your site is live, the function is reachable at `https://<your-site>/.netlify/functions/accountDeletion`. Use the marketplace’s “Send Test Notification” tool to confirm you receive a `204 No Content` response and inspect your Netlify function logs for the recorded payload. If you are manually testing with `curl`, you can also send the raw token in an `x-verification-token` header – the function keeps that legacy path enabled to make local smoke tests easier.

If you host elsewhere, deploy the handler to any HTTPS endpoint that enforces the same token check and routes to the same logic.

## Running tests

```bash
python -m unittest
```

The suite covers slug generation, affiliate link enforcement, blog copy rendering, and JSON persistence logic.

## Extending the system

- Adjust or add categories in `giftgrab/config.py` – the pipeline automatically loops over whatever is defined there.
- Tweak the marketing copy templates in `giftgrab/blog.py` to change the tone of the generated blurbs.
- Override the CSS in `giftgrab/generator.py` if you want a different visual identity.
- Hook in your favourite deployment mechanism by scripting around the CLI commands.

## Caveats

- Amazon’s PA-API has request throttling; keep `--item-count` reasonable (6–10 per category) or throttle the scheduler.
- The project does not ship with API credentials – be sure to set the required environment variables before running `update`.
- The Unsplash hero images are loaded at runtime; swap to your own static assets for guaranteed availability.

Happy curating!
